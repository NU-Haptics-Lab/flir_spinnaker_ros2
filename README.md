# FLIR/Spinnaker ROS2 driver

This ROS2 driver for FLIR cameras using the Spinnaker SDK is no longer
developed. It has been rolled into the [humble-devel branch of the
ros-drivers
repository](https://github.com/ros-drivers/flir_camera_driver/tree/humble-devel). The
new driver will be released as a rosdistro package. The only change is
that the config files now are in yaml format.
